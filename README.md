O B.O.T. Finder was created to respond to the challenge "Where's my coffee mug?" proposed in the subject Advanced Industrial Vision Systems at the University of Aveiro.
It consists of a system that, from a given cloud of points, can detect and extract objects, calculate some of their characteristics and in turn classify the detected object, based on a previously trained deep learning classifier. Finally being able to return the name of the objects and some of their characteristics.

The data used for training the classifier and the point clouds can be accessed at [Washington RGB-D Dataset](http://rgbd-dataset.cs.washington.edu/dataset/).
The dataset for the classifier ([RGB-D Object Dataset](http://rgbd-dataset.cs.washington.edu/dataset/)) contains 300 objects grouped into 51 categories.
The dataset [RGB-D Scenes Dataset](http://rgbd-dataset.cs.washington.edu/dataset/rgbd-scenes-v2/) contains the 14 scenes with furniture (sofas and tables) and a subset of the objects present from the RGB-D Object Dataset (bowls, caps, cereal boxes, coffee mugs, and soda cans).
